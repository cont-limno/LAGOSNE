Data frames with all or a subset of the following variables. Number
of observations is equal to the number of zones in each spatial
classification (see ?classifications). Wildcard options include a subset of
the LAGOSNE spatial classifications (* = buffer500m, iws,
hu12, hu8, hu4, edu, county, state) and additional wildcards described
below.

     without outflows, and no upstream lakes greater than 10 ha), and lake
     drainage lakes ("drlakeStream" lakes with inflowing stream(s) and at
     least one upstream lake greater than 10 ha).
