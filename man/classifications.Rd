    county)

    hu12, edu)
    \item *_ha_in_usa: area (ha) of polygon within the US boundary (* = iws,

    Wetland Inventory (NWI) boundary (* = hu12, hu8, hu4, edu, county,
    state)
    \item *_zoneid: a unique identifier for each IWS in LAGOSNE, numbered 1:n
    with classification prefix (e.g., HU12_1) (* = iws, hu12, hu8, hu4, edu,
    county, state)
    \item lagoslakeid: LAGOSNE unique identifier for focal lake

\description{
Data frames containing metadata for each spatial classification at which
 ecological context data are derived in LAGOSNE. The spatial classifications
 include 100m buffers (buffer100m),
 500m buffers (buffer500m), interlake watersheds (iws),
 hydrologic units (hu12, hu8, hu4), ecological drainage units (edu),
 counties (county), and states (state). Each abbreviation is the name of the
 data frame, with all or a subset of the following variables. For more
 information about derivation of each spatial classification, see Details
 below or Additional file 7 from \doi{10.1186/s13742-015-0067-4}.

\details{
The nine LAGOSNE spatial classifications were used to summarize the ecological
context of each lake. Ecological context themes include
land use/land cover (LULC), connectivity (CONN), and climate, hydrology,
atmospheric deposition, and groundwater (CHAG). Not all themes were derived
at all classifications due to data availability. Briefly:
\itemize{
    \item iws: a dataframe with 51065 observations of 12 variables. The area
    of land that drains directly into a lake, and into all
    upstream-connected, permanent streams to that lake exclusive of any
    upstream lake watersheds for lakes greater than  10 ha that are
    connected via permanent streams.  For details on how the watersheds were
    delineated, see additional file 8 in Soranno et al. (2015). Themes
    derived at the iws classification include LULC and CONN.
    \item buffer100m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
    Buffers are a 100 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 100 m from
    the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
    derived at the 100m buffer classification include LULC.
    \item buffer500m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
    Buffers are a 500 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 500 m from
    the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
    derived at the 500m buffer classification include LULC and CONN.
    \item hu12: a dataframe with 20257 observations of 11 variables. The
    Watershed Boundary Dataset defines boundaries based on surface water
    drainage and creates nested Hydrologic Units (sometimes abbreviated and
    referred to as HUCs, which are hydrologic unit codes) that are
    georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 topographic base map. HUC12s are the
    sixth level of classificiation. HUC12s are defined along natural
    hydrologic breaks based on land surface and surface-water flow and they
    have a single flow outlet except in frontal, lake, braided-stream, or
    closed-basin hydrologic units. Themes derived at the HUC12
    classification include LULC, CONN and CHAG.
    \item hu8: a data frame with 511 observations of 9 variables. HUC8s are
    the fourth level of classificiation. Sometimes called 'watersheds', a
    HUC8 is a geographic area representing part or all of a surface
    drainage basin, a combination of drainage basins, or a distinct
    hydrologic feature. Themes derived at the HUC8 classification include
    LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
    \item hu4: a data frame with 65 observations of 9 variables. HUC4s are
    the second level of classification, called a 'subregion'. A subregion
    includes the area drained by a river system, a reach of a river and its
    tributaries in that reach, a closed basin(s), or a group of streams
    forming a coastal drainage area. Themes derived at the HUC4
    classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
    \item edu: a data frame with 91 observations of 10 variables.
    Ecological drainage units (EDUs) follow the WBD boundaries, and are of
    roughly similar size to HUC6s. EDUs were delineated by grouping the
    HUC8 watersheds based on common zoogeographic history, and
    physiographic and climatic characteristics. Themes derived at the EDU
    classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
    \item county: a data frame with 955 observations of 8 variables.
    Counties (political boundary) within the 17-state region of LAGOSNE.
    Themes derived at the county classification include LULC, CONN, and
    CHAG.
    \item state: a dataframe with 17 observations of 7 variables. Themes
    derived at the state classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
