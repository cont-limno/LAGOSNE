\format{
Data frames with all or a subset of the following variables. Number
of observations is equal to the number of zones in each spatial scale (see
Details below). Wildcard options include a subset of the LAGOSNE spatial
scales (* = hu12, hu8, hu4, edu, county, state), years of measurement
(** = 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010), and summary statistic or
units (*** = min, max, mean, std for atmospheric deposition and hydrology;
 *** = ha, pct for surficial geology)
\itemize{

\description{
Datasets containing information on climate, hydrology, atmospheric
deposition, and surficial geology characteristics calculated at hu12, hu8,
hu4, edu, county and state spatial classifications (see ?scales).
}
\details{
Original data sources and layers from which each metric was derived can be
found in additional file 5 of Soranno et al. (2015). Briefly, climate data
came from the PRISM climate group, hydrology metrics were derived from
United States Geologic Survey (USGS) data, atmospheric deposition was from
the National Atmospheric Deposition program, and surficial geology were
derived from layers USGS data.
