#' LAGOSNE Spatial Classifications Metadata
#'
#' Data frames containing metadata for each spatial classification at which
#'  ecological context data are derived in LAGOSNE. The spatial classifications
#'  include 100m buffers (buffer100m),
#'  500m buffers (buffer500m), interlake watersheds (iws),
#'  hydrologic units (hu12, hu8, hu4), ecological drainage units (edu),
#'  counties (county), and states (state). Each abbreviation is the name of the
#'  data frame, with all or a subset of the following variables. For more
#'  information about derivation of each spatial classification, see Details
#'  below or Additional file 7 from \doi{10.1186/s13742-015-0067-4}.
#'
#' The nine LAGOSNE spatial classifications were used to summarize the ecological
#' context of each lake. Ecological context themes include
#' land use/land cover (LULC), connectivity (CONN), and climate, hydrology,
#' atmospheric deposition, and groundwater (CHAG). Not all themes were derived
#' at all classifications due to data availability. Briefly:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item iws: a dataframe with 51065 observations of 12 variables. The area
#'     of land that drains directly into a lake, and into all
#'     upstream-connected, permanent streams to that lake exclusive of any
#'     upstream lake watersheds for lakes greater than  10 ha that are
#'     connected via permanent streams.  For details on how the watersheds were
#'     delineated, see additional file 8 in Soranno et al. (2015). Themes
#'     derived at the iws classification include LULC and CONN.
#'     \item buffer100m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
#'     Buffers are a 100 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 100 m from
#'     the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
#'     derived at the 100m buffer classification include LULC.
#'     \item buffer500m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
#'     Buffers are a 500 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 500 m from
#'     the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
#'     derived at the 500m buffer classification include LULC and CONN.
#'     \item hu12: a dataframe with 20257 observations of 11 variables. The
#'     Watershed Boundary Dataset defines boundaries based on surface water
#'     drainage and creates nested Hydrologic Units (sometimes abbreviated and
#'     referred to as HUCs, which are hydrologic unit codes) that are
#'     georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 topographic base map. HUC12s are the
#'     sixth level of classificiation. HUC12s are defined along natural
#'     hydrologic breaks based on land surface and surface-water flow and they
#'     have a single flow outlet except in frontal, lake, braided-stream, or
#'     closed-basin hydrologic units. Themes derived at the HUC12
#'     classification include LULC, CONN and CHAG.
#'     \item hu8: a data frame with 511 observations of 9 variables. HUC8s are
#'     the fourth level of classificiation. Sometimes called 'watersheds', a
#'     HUC8 is a geographic area representing part or all of a surface
#'     drainage basin, a combination of drainage basins, or a distinct
#'     hydrologic feature. Themes derived at the HUC8 classification include
#'     LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item hu4: a data frame with 65 observations of 9 variables. HUC4s are
#'     the second level of classification, called a 'subregion'. A subregion
#'     includes the area drained by a river system, a reach of a river and its
#'     tributaries in that reach, a closed basin(s), or a group of streams
#'     forming a coastal drainage area. Themes derived at the HUC4
#'     classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item edu: a data frame with 91 observations of 10 variables.
#'     Ecological drainage units (EDUs) follow the WBD boundaries, and are of
#'     roughly similar size to HUC6s. EDUs were delineated by grouping the
#'     HUC8 watersheds based on common zoogeographic history, and
#'     physiographic and climatic characteristics. Themes derived at the EDU
#'     classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
#'     \item county: a data frame with 955 observations of 8 variables.
#'     Counties (political boundary) within the 17-state region of LAGOSNE.
#'     Themes derived at the county classification include LULC, CONN, and
#'     CHAG.
#'     \item state: a dataframe with 17 observations of 7 variables. Themes
#'     derived at the state classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
